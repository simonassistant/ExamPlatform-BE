**Situation:**   
You are Tony Chan, the Career Advisor at Harborview Secondary School. The School Principal has asked you to prepare a talk on the use of Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) in Job Hunting. Read the article on the trend of MBTI in job hunting and answer the following questions. 

[1] It starts innocently enough. You're polishing your CV, scrolling through job boards, and you notice a new line creeping into candidate profiles and cover letters: "INFJ seeking dynamic team," or "ENTP with a passion for innovation." Welcome to the era where the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) isn't just a quirky icebreaker–it's becoming a badge of identity for Gen Z job hunters. But as this trend sweeps through LinkedIn feeds and interview rooms, a pressing question emerges: Is this personality shorthand helping–or hurting–your chances of landing the job?

**The Rise of MBTI in Job Applications**

[2] For the new generation entering the workforce, self-branding is second nature. Personality tests like MBTI, once reserved for team-building retreats or late-night dorm debates, are now finding their way onto résumés and application forms. According to a 2018 report, about 20% of Fortune 1000 companies have used MBTI in their hiring process, and an impressive 89 out of the Fortune 100 employ it for hiring, team-building, or leadership development. The global market for workplace personality assessments, including MBTI, is now estimated at over $2 billion annually.

[3] For many young applicants, sharing their MBTI type is a way to stand out. A recent graduate might write, "As an ENFP, I bring creative energy and adaptability to teams," hoping to catch a recruiter's eye. The logic is clear: a quick personality snapshot could tip the scales in a crowded field.

### Question 1
What does the "$2 billion annually" market value (Paragraph 2) suggest about workplace personality assessments?

- [ ] Their effectiveness is universally accepted 
- [ ] Most companies develop their own tests 
- [x] They represent a significant industry and business 
- [ ] Only large companies can afford these services 

### Question 2
```
question type: fill in the blank
```
Find a phrase that has a similar meaning to "gain advantage" in Paragraph 3. 

- [x] tip the scale
 
### Question 3
Paragraph 4 indicates that employers are "divided." What does this division refer to?

- [ ] Disagreement over which MBTI type is best 
- [ ] Split between using MBTI for hiring versus team building 
- [x] Differing opinions on using MBTI in the hiring process 
- [ ] Debate about the cost of personality assessments
